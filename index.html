                <p>It's Kemonologue version 0.0.0! üéâ</p>
                <p>This site is something I've wanted to make for a long time, but getting it fully planned and perfect before even starting to code has been something of a road block, to say the least. Frustrated at the lack of progress I wanted to try a different approach &mdash; building it from the ground up and figuring out what I want this site to be and look like along the way. So this version is just text, no images, no CSS, no nothing! We're going back to the <em>basics</em>!</p>
                <p>I've added a page to list my characters, there's just one at the moment but I'm sure I'll add more in the future. I also added a page for my fursona, Donovan, with some basic info about him. Next I'd like to add some images to his profile, along with a gallery of the furry art I've drawn so far.</p>
