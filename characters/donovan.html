            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>When first meeting Donovan you might think him a miserable fellow, or you might think him bubbly and outgoing. Both of these are true, it just depends on which 'Donovan' you meet first. The truth is, he's a rather two-faced character.</p>
            <p>Normally he's quite reserved, keeping to himself and wearing an expression that gives the impression he's been walking around with wet socks all day. Beneath the perpetual frown however, is a rather merry mammal. Despite how he may appear on the outside Donovan is fairly optimistic, looking on the bright side where he can and assuring himself that this too will pass when he can't. Sweeping his hair out of his face he adopts a persona much more fitting of his personality. It's not exactly a lie, but to be so outwardly sunny doesn't come naturally and the fa&ccedil;ade can only last so long.</p>
